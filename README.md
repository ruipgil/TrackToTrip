# TrackToTrip
*TrackToTrip* is a library to process GPS tracks.

The main goals are to transform a (gpx) **track into a trip**.

> **track**
> raw representation of a GPS recording. It is not precise, has noise and valuable information is hidden.


> **trip**
> result of one or more processed tracks. Its start and end points have semantic meaning, such as home, work or school. It has less errors and it's compressed, with as little information loss as possible. In short, a trip is an approximation of the true path recorded.

## Installing

You can install *TrackToTrip* with *[pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tracktotrip)* or *EasyInstall*,

```
pip install tracktotrip
```

or

```
easy_install install tracktotrip
```

**Python 2.x** is required, mainly because of the [ikalman](https://github.com/ruipgil/ikalman) package.

You may want to install the dependencies with *easyinstall* first, to avoid building libraries such as *numpy*.

## Overview

The starting points are the [Track](../master/tracktotrip/track.py), [Segment](../master/tracktotrip/segment.py) and [Point](../master/tracktotrip/point.py) classes.

### [Track](../master/tracktotrip/track.py)

Can be loaded from a GPX file:

```python
from tracktotrip import Track, Segment, Point

track = Track.from_gpx(open('file_to_track.gpx', 'r'))
```

A track can be transformed into a trip with the method ` to_trip `. Transforming a track into a trip executes the following steps:

1. Smooths the segments, using the [kalman filter](../master/tracktotrip/smooth.py)

2. Spatiotemporal segmentation for each segment, using the [DBSCAN algorithm](../master/tracktotrip/spatiotemporal_segmentation.py) to find spatiotemporal clusters

3. Compresses every segment, using [spatiotemporal-aware compression algorithm](../master/tracktotrip/compression.py)

A track is composed by ` Segment `s, and each segment by ` Point `s.

It can be saved to a GPX file:

```python
with open('file.gpx', 'w') as f:
  f.write(track.to_gpx())
```

### [Segment](../master/tracktotrip/segment.py)

A Segment holds the points, the transportation modes used, and the start and end semantic locations.

### [Point](../master/tracktotrip/point.py)

A Point holds the position and time. Currently the library doesn't support elevation.

*TrackToTrip* is flexible, with lots of parameters. For general parameters, refer to [` processmysteps.default_config `](https://github.com/ruipgil/ProcessMySteps/blob/master/processmysteps/default_config.py)

## Transportation mode classification

For transportation mode classification, TrackToTrip uses a wrapper around sklearn's classifiers. We consider two different classifiers: the [Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html#sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier), and [CART Decision Tree Classifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier), both implemented by [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/).

To classify a segment (trip) we first do changepoint segmentation, which sub-divides a segment into points where there was a change in mean the absolute velocity difference.
For each sub-segment we then extract features.

Feature extraction is based on cumulative speed, and the amount of time spent at them. We create a [histogram](../master/docs/histogram.pdf), where the bins the velocity (rounded) and the bin values are the percentage of time spent at a certain velocity (bin 10 is 10km/h). Then we create a [cumulative histogram](../master/docs/cum_histograms.pdf), and extract the velocities where the cumulative value surpasses 10, 20 to 90% of the time.

For instance, for a sub-division marked as *walk*, we get the features:

```
[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]
```

This means that 90% (index 8)  of the velocity is 3km/h, and 50% (index 4) of the sub-division was spent below 2km/h.

To train the default classifier we used the [GeoLife GPS Trajectories](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52367) dataset. We provide command line scripts to download the dataset and transform it to GPX.

We used the labels: *foot*, *airplane*, *train* and (motor) *vehicle*. The foot label includes data marked as *run* and *walk*. The train label is composed of data marked as *train* and *subway*. And the *vehicle* label is the combination of *taxi*, *bus*, *motorcycle* and *car* samples. We compressed the possible labels because of two factors:
  + Lack of relevant data. Only 4 samples were marked as *run*;
  + Transportation modes that belong to the same category. *Taxi*, *car* and *bus* are similar transportation modes, with a similar feature set.
We also don't use tracks marked as *boat* and *bike*. Because there's only seven *boat* samples, and because *bike* features are reduce the quality of classification and is rarely used by us.

To evaluate the classifiers we perform [two-fold validation](../master/scripts/two_fold_validation.py) with a 50% split of the data.

Using a SGD Classifier obtain a score between 84% and 86% (we use random permutation during training). Using a decision tree we obtain a score of 83%. These values drop to around 70% using the *bike* labels.

[The ` classification_validation.txt ` file offers more details](../master/docs/classifier_validation.txt).
